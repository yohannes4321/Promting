Prompting Techniques in AI Models

1. Instructional Prompts

Instructional prompting is a technique used to guide AI models toward generating more accurate and relevant responses by providing explicit instructions. This type of prompting ensures that the model understands the required format, tone, or depth of information in its response.

2. Few-Shot Learning

Few-shot learning involves providing the model with a few examples (shots) of the desired input-output pairs before presenting the actual prompt. This technique helps the model generalize and produce outputs aligned with the demonstrated pattern.

 

3. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting

CoT prompting is a technique that encourages the model to break down its reasoning step by step. This improves the model’s ability to solve complex problems by making its reasoning process explicit.

3.1 Chain-of-Thought Example

Prompt:

A bakery sells 3 types of cakes: chocolate ($5), vanilla ($4), and strawberry ($6). If Alice buys 2 chocolate cakes and 1 vanilla cake, how much does she pay?

Think step by step.

Model Output:

Alice buys 2 chocolate cakes, each costing $5. So, 2 × 5 = $10.

Alice buys 1 vanilla cake costing $4.

Total cost = $10 + $4 = $14.

4. Self-Consistency Prompting

Self-consistency is an enhancement to CoT prompting where multiple reasoning paths are generated, and the most consistent or frequent answer is selected. This improves reliability and accuracy, especially in tasks requiring logical deduction.

4.1 Self-Consistency Example

Prompt:

 

5. Generate Knowledge Prompting

This technique involves prompting the model to generate background knowledge before answering a question. This helps improve performance on reasoning-heavy tasks by allowing the model to create context before making a final decision.

5.1 Generate Knowledge Example

Prompt:

Before answering, explain how gravity affects the motion of objects.
Why do astronauts float in space?

Model Output:Gravity is the force that pulls objects toward each other. On Earth, it keeps everything grounded. In space, astronauts float because they are in freefall around the Earth, experiencing microgravity.
